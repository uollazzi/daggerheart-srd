## FEATURES

***Terrifying - Passive:*** When the Oracle makes a successful attack, all PCs within Far range lose a Hope and you gain a Fear.

***Walls Closing In - Passive:*** When a creature rolls a failure while within Very Far range of the Oracle, they must mark a Stress.

***Pronounce Fate - Action:*** Spend a Fear to present a target within Far range with a vision of their personal nightmare. The target must make a Knowledge Reaction Roll. On a failure, they lose all Hope and take 2d10+4 direct magic damage. On a success, they take half damage and lose a Hope.

***Ominous Knowledge - Reaction:*** When the Oracle sees a mortal creature, they instantly know one of their personal nightmares.

***Vengeful Fate - Reaction:*** When the Oracle marks HP from an attack within Very Close range, you can mark a Stress to knock the attacker back to Far range and deal 2d10+4 physical damage.
