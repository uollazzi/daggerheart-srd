## FEATURES

***Relentless (2) - Passive:*** The Seraph can be spotlighted up to three times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.

***Divine Flight - Passive:*** While the Seraph is flying, spend a Fear to move up to Far range instead of Close range before taking an action.

***Judgment - Action:*** Spend a Fear to make a target Guilty in the eyes of the Seraph’s god until the Seraph is defeated. While Guilty, the target doesn’t gain Hope on a result with Hope. When the Seraph succeeds on a standard attack against a Guilty target, they deal Severe damage instead of their standard damage. The Seraph can only mark one target at a time.

***God Rays - Action:*** Mark a Stress to reflect a sliver of divinity as a searing beam of light that hits up to twenty targets within Very Far range. Targets must make a Presence Reaction Roll, with disadvantage if they are marked Guilty. Targets who fail take 4d6+12 magic damage. Targets who succeed take half damage.

***We Are One - Action:*** Once per scene, spend a Fear to spotlight all other adversaries within Far range. Attacks they make while spotlighted in this way deal half damage.
