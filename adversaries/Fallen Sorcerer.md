## FEATURES

***Conflagration - Action:*** Spend a Fear to unleash an all-consuming firestorm and make an attack against all targets within Close range. Targets the Sorcerer succeeds against take 2d10+6 direct magic damage.

***Nightmare Tableau - Action:*** Mark a Stress to trap a target within Far range in a powerful illusion of their worst fears. While trapped, the target is Restrained and Vulnerable until they break free, ending both conditions, with a successful Instinct Roll.

***Slippery - Reaction:*** When the Sorcerer takes damage from an attack, they can teleport up to Far range.

***Shackles of Guilt - Reaction:*** Countdown (Loop 2d6). When the Sorcerer is in the spotlight for the first time, activate the countdown. When it triggers, all targets within Far range become Vulnerable and must mark a Stress as they relive their greatest regrets. A target can break free from their regret with a successful Presence or Strength Roll. When a PC fails to break free, they lose a Hope.
