# KRAKEN

***Tier 4 Solo***  
*A legendary beast of the sea, bigger than the largest galleon, with sucker-laden tentacles and a terrifying maw.*  
**Motives & Tactics:** Consume, crush, drown, grapple

> **Difficulty:** 20 | **Thresholds:** 35/70 | **HP:** 11 | **Stress:** 8  
> **ATK:** +7 | **Tentacles:** Close | 4d12+10 phy  
> **Experience:** Swimming +3

## FEATURES

***Relentless (3) - Passive:*** The Kraken can be spotlighted up to three times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.

***Many Tentacles - Passive:*** While the Kraken has 7 or fewer marked HP, they can make their standard attack against two targets within range.

***Grapple and Drown - Action:*** Make an attack roll against a target within Close range. On a success, mark a Stress to grab them with a tentacle and drag them beneath the water. The target is Restrained and Vulnerable until they break free with a successful Strength Roll or the Kraken takes Major or greater damage. While Restrained and Vulnerable in this way, a target must mark a Stress when they make an action roll.

***Boiling Blast - Action:*** Spend a Fear to spew a line of boiling water at any number of targets in a line up to Far range. All targets must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or take 4d6+9 physical damage. If a target marks an Armor Slot to reduce the damage, they must also mark a Stress.

***Momentum - Reaction:*** When the Kraken makes a successful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear.
