## FEATURES

***Relentless (2) - Passive:*** The Gorgon can be spotlighted up to two times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.

***Suneater Arrows - Passive:*** When the Gorgon makes a successful standard attack, the target Glows until the end of the scene and can’t become Hidden. Attack rolls made against a Glowing target have advantage.

***Crown of Serpents - Action:*** Make an attack roll against a target within Melee range using the Gorgon’s protective snakes. On a success, mark Stress to deal 2d10+4 physical damage and the target must mark a Stress.

***Petrifying Gaze - Reaction:*** When the Gorgon takes damage from an attack within Close range, you can spend a Fear to force the attacker to make an Instinct Reaction Roll. On a failure, they begin to turn to stone, marking a HP and starting a Petrification Countdown (4). This countdown ticks down when the Gorgon is attacked. When it triggers, the target must make a death move. If the Gorgon is defeated, all petrification countdowns end.

***Death Glare - Reaction:*** When the Gorgon makes a successful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear.
